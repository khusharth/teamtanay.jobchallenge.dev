Registration is just the first step. Once done, go back to coding.
* Start creating your 5 projects.
* Complete your 3 blogs.
* And get your 2 reviews.

Meanwhile, if you need help checkout our blogs. If you need more help in something let our community know how/where can we help. Don't expect mentors to debug your code. However, if you need any dev design related help, that can be provided by us.

The challenge is ON. Complete it and keep polishing your code/project.
