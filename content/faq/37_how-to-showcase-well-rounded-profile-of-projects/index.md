I'll share a list of free and paid courses which you can take to learn React and React Native for this challenge.

I would suggest out of 5 projects do one or two back-end projects as well on Node and GraphQL.
It will round up your profile well.

I have provided a few examples here as well.
Do any 5, but show variety on the stack
1. Back-end on Node.
2. Node plus GraphQL.
3. React Native app (release it on Google Play at least).
4. A chrome/vscode/mozilla plugin.
5. A React app.
6. One more React app.
7. A vanillaJS app, (this will help you in interviews as well).
8. HTML5 canvas based game.
9. A React app with offline capabilities i.e. PWA.
10. Publish your npm packages with tests, docs and versioning.

Advanced:
1. Create your own mini JS framework. Showcase design patternâ€™s understanding through this.

I'll keep adding more to the list. Will ask mentors to give more ideas as well.
