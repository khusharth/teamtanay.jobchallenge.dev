Think about it. What's the aim of this challenge? To impress someone enough that they hire you right? How will you impress someone by showing projects? 

Two ways:
1. Work on different tech and domains, and show that you have breadth.
2. Work on the same tech and domain, but create some breathtaking features to show that you have depth.

So, I will leave it to you all. Decide what you wanna showcase. Your depth, or your breadth.
