**No!**

But if you and your friend are working on different stacks, here's how you can break it.

* Make backend as a service. Document it. Write tests for it. Like how Github APIs are.
* Make frontend as a service. Document it. Write tests for it. Like how Bootstrap is.
* Now there are two projects instead of one. You both can submit your work.
