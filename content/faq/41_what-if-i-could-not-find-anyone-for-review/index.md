You will have enough people. Don't worry. You have to try and keep your eyes open. Learn to ask. Fail. And repeat.
Worst case, you'll have to ask the other participants or in social media.

Focus on completing the 5 plus 3 first, then worry about the 2.
Because by the time you reach to the 2, youâ€™ll have enough reach and someone will definitely review or recommend you.
So, if you complete 5 plus 3, I'll guide you to get the rest 2.
