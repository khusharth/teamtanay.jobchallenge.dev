Push daily changes. Push more. No need to keep it clean. We'll see your streak. We want to witness your journey, the problems you faced, and how did you overcome those problems.
Even when you write a blog, put it in a repo, in a PR, and then ask for review. People will comment on the PR, then merge it.
