It's not stack specific. You submit your projects, if it wins, it wins.

If you can create an API or an app, basically any interface to your ML projects, then you're in. Actually, you will have a good chance to win as well.

But can you submit a Jupyter notebook?
No! In a real world, data scientists need to know how to get their model to production as well. This challenge is about solving real world problems. Give us a great interface with documentation and it's a project.
However, the demand is very less for a data scientist job. 

See this [FAQ](https://2020.teamtanay.jobchallenge.dev/10_limited_by_tech_stack/) to get a brief answer.
