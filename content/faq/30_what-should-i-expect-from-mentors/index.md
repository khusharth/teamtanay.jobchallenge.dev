Mentors btw are not going to help you with errors. This challenge is about you, deal with your own errors. How self sufficient you are. Don't expect people to debug your code.

Mentors will help you decide stack, decide project maybe. They'll guide you. And sometimes review your code and blog.

Again, no one should expect mentors to debug your code.
